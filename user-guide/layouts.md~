# Layouts

Tapestry lets you control the layout of the generated query files. You
can organize the queries in two ways:

1. `one-file-one-query`: Each SQL query will be written to a separate file
2. `one-file-all-queries`: All SQL queries will be written to a single file

This can be specified using `query_output_layout` key in the manifest
file. If not specified, `one-file-one-query` will be considered as
default.

When layout is set to `one-file-all-queries`, it's expected that the
`output` field for all queries is the same i.e. path to the file that
all SQL will be written to. To avoid this duplication, you may
configure an associated setting `query_output_file`.
